Educational notes on market structure, volatility, and risk management.
This repository contains educational material focused on understanding
market structure, volatility, and risk management.

The purpose of this project is to document how markets behave,
how structure forms, and how disciplined thinking can reduce emotional decisions.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Market structure concepts  
- Volatility expansion & contraction  
- Risk management frameworks  
- Trade filtering logic  

## Philosophy

Markets move based on participation and liquidity.
Understanding this allows traders to focus on *process*, not prediction.

I believe clarity comes from:
- Structure over noise  
- Patience over prediction  
- Consistency over emotion
