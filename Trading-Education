## What This Section Covers

## Core Philosophy

Markets move due to:
- Participation  
- Liquidity  
- Order flow imbalance  

Price does not move randomly, but it also cannot be predicted with certainty.

Successful trading comes from:
- Reading structure
- Managing risk
- Controlling emotions
- Following a repeatable process
